# hello-world_rish
My first repository. It will host some knowledgeable insights about the things I like in tech.

Hey!
I am Rishabh. I can't believe that I am actually learning to use Github after even completing a Masters degree in engineering.
But, we can't move forward in life without making humge or small mistakes.
Let's hope I stumble around till I sort out what journey I need to take!
